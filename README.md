This is a test practice file for GitHub. Feel free to alter, clone, delete, add, commit, and do whatever to this file.

To kill two birds with one stone, I figured we could play with a list of team names. Again, alter at will. I added a couple for fun-- nothing that I'm married to in any way...

Current proposed team names:

A-Team
Hack to the Future
Hack & Morty
Code RED: You Can't Handle The Truth!
Fantictac Four
